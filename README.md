This repository contains all the tasks for the Data Science and Analytics Intern at The Sparks Foundation.


***TASK - 1 :---------***
Improve our LinkedIn profile.


***TASK - 2 :---------***
To Explore Supervised Machine Learning
In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. 
This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.


***TASK - 3 :---------***
To Explore Unsupervised Machine Learning
From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.


***TASK - 4 :---------***
For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. 
The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
